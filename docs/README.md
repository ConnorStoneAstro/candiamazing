# Documentation Source (`docs/`)

This directory contains the source files for the `candiamazing` documentation website. We use **Jupyter Book** to compile these files into the HTML site you see online.

Unlike standard comments in your code, this folder allows you to write full tutorials, include mathematical equations, and even execute Python code directly in the browser.

## File Breakdown

Here is an explanation of the standard files you will find in this directory and what role they play in the documentation build process.

### 1. The Configuration (`_config.yml`)
This is the global settings file for your documentation.
* **Purpose:** It controls the "look and feel" of your site.
* **What goes here:** The book's title, the author's name, the path to the project logo, and repository button settings (like the "Open in GitHub" button).

### 2. The Structure (`_toc.yml`)
"TOC" stands for **Table of Contents**. This file defines the sidebar navigation menu on the website.
* **Purpose:** It tells Jupyter Book which files to include and in what order.
* **Important:** If you create a new markdown file or notebook but forget to add it to `_toc.yml`, it will **not** appear on the website!

### 3. Build Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)
This file lists the Python packages needed specifically to **build the documentation**.
* **Purpose:** Separate from your package's main dependencies.
* **Typical contents:** `jupyter-book`, `sphinx`, `matplotlib` (if your tutorials plot graphs), and `candiamazing` (your package itself, so the notebooks can import it).

### 4. The Landing Page (`intro.md`)
This is the "Home" page of your documentation website.
* **Purpose:** To welcome new users.
* **Content:** A high-level overview of what the package does, a quick "badge" showing the latest version, and a link to the installation page.

### 5. Installation Guide (`install.md`)
A dedicated page for setup instructions.
* **Purpose:** While the main README has a quickstart, this page can go into detail about troubleshooting, installing on different operating systems (Windows vs Mac), or setting up virtual environments.

### 6. Interactive Tutorials (`exampleusage.ipynb`)
This is a standard Jupyter Notebook file.
* **Purpose:** To demonstrate the code in action.
* **Why it's powerful:** Jupyter Book executes this notebook during the build process. If your code produces a plot or a specific output, the documentation will show the **actual output** generated by the code. This ensures your documentation never gets out of sync with your code logic.

### 7. Legal (`license.md`)
A copy of the project's license (e.g., MIT, BSD).
* **Purpose:** Including this in the documentation ensures that users browsing the website can easily find the legal terms of use without having to dig through the GitHub repository source code.

### 8. Contribution Guide (`contributing.md`)
A copy of the contribution instructions.
* **Purpose:** It helps convert documentation readers into code contributors by making the "How to Help" guide easily accessible from the website sidebar.

## How to Build the Docs

To turn these source files into a website on your local machine, run the following command from the **root** of your repository (one level up):

```bash
# syntax: jupyter-book build <path-to-docs-folder>
jupyter-book build docs/

```

Once finished, open the generated HTML file in your browser:
`docs/_build/html/index.html`
